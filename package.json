  "description": "### Base instructions   * Fork this repository and clone it in a new Cloud9 workspace.   * As you open the project in Cloud9, open notice there is a file called `.gitignore`. Open this file to check its contents.   * Notice that the `.gitignore` file contains one line that says \"`node_modules`\". What this is doing is telling Git that it should ignore the contents of the `node_modules` directory. Since the code in there comes from the outside world, we don't need to save it in our repo.   * **All the code of this workshop will go in master**. After your first commit, push and create a pull-request. Then, create a pull-request after each exercise.",
